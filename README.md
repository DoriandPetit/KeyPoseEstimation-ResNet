# KeyPoseEstimation-ResNet
KeyPose Estimation Project on Stickman using notably ResNet ideas and HourGlass architectures

The report (in english) is in the pdf file. Please note that we did not have access to the test dataset. Because we sent the file in a wrong way the first time to our teacher, we do not have the test scores of our models. However, we still made quite a lot of observations and remarks that might be interesting when using these kind of models.
